# Welcome to the Edinburgh Concepts and Causality Lab

We study high-level cognition, with a particular focus on how people represent causality, and how causality structures people's mental representations. 

One of the main outputs of our research has been a theory of causal selection, i.e. how people determine the relative causal responsibility of the different factors that led to an event. See [here](/Quillien%202020%20actual%20causation.pdf) for a short paper, [here](/Quillien%20&%20Lucas%202023.pdf) for a much longer paper, and [here](/Quillien%20&%20Barlev%202022.pdf) for a fun real-world case study.

We are also interested in the role of causality in the structure of everyday concepts. See [here](/Quillien%20&%20German%202021.pdf) for the concept of the concept of intentional action, and [here](/Quillien%202018.pdf) or [here](/Marchant%20et%20al%202023.pdf) for more general considerations.

Our general approach is that of **computational cognitive science**: we try to formalize the computations that a particular cognitive system is designed to solve, at a relatively high level of abstraction. In doing so we use tools like probability and information theory.
