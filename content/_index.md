# Welcome to the Edinburgh Concepts and Causality Lab

{{< textpic image="/edinburgh-picture-scott-chambers.jpg" alt="alt_text" width="300" >}}

We study how the mind works, using a combination of psychology experiments and computational modeling. We are based in the School of Philosophy, Psychology and Language Sciences at the University of Edinburgh.

The lab has a particular focus on how people represent causality, and how causality structures people's mental representations. 

One of the main outputs of our research has been a theory of how people judge the relative causal responsibility of the different factors that led to an event. See [here](/Quillien%202020%20actual%20causation.pdf) for a short paper, [here](/Quillien%20&%20Lucas%202023.pdf) for a much longer paper, and [here](/Quillien%20&%20Barlev%202022.pdf) for a fun real-world case study.

We are also interested in the role of causality in the structure of everyday concepts. See [here](/Quillien%20&%20German%202021.pdf) for the concept of intentional action, and [here](/Quillien%202018.pdf) or [here](/Marchant%20et%20al%202023.pdf) for more general considerations.

We draw on the insights of several different fields, including:

- **computational cognitive science**: we like to think about the information-processing problems that the mind is designed to solve, at a relatively high level of abstraction. To do so we use tools like probability, information theory and causal modeling. 

- **experimental philosophy**: we think that laypeople's intuitions about philosophical questions hold rich insights about how the mind works. Therefore our research draws on, and contributes to, work studying these intuitions.

- **evolutionary biology**: evolution is a powerful meta-theoretical framework to study how biological systems work, including the human mind.
