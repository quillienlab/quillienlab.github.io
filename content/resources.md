## Agent-based models

These agent-based models of social evolution were developed as a pedagogical tool for the class Psy155: Evolution & Cognition at UCSB. The models are written in python; you can access the Jupyter Notebooks at the following [GitHub repository](https://github.com/tadegquillien/ABMs), and also run them online with [binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/tadegquillien/ABMs/88a3263ea940ad5aadca8922d0beabf06730d13d). Models include:
